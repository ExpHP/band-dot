# band-dot
This is a script I wrote a while back for matching bands in an attempt to try and uncross bands in an extremely dense band plot.

...it didn't work fantastically well for that purpose.  But, I needed it again recently for something else, so I tossed it up onto this repo.

Documentation/screenshots/examples TBD

I put it on my main account for now as I actively work on it, but if not much happens here then it'll eventually be moved to [the graveyard](https://github.com/exphp-share/).
